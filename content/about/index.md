I'm a web developer from Arizona who loves identifying and solving the many small puzzles that build towards big picture solutions. I specialize in creating lean performant full stack web applications and websites with an eye toward UX.

My freelancing company [Branta Web](https://brantaweb.com/) has helped researchers, artists, and professionals improve their online presence.
