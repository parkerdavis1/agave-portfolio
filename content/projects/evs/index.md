## Overview
I collaborated closely with other developers to create an application that allows [The Barn](https://www.thebarnaz.com/) to schedule volunteers for their horse lessons and horse therapy. It was done in collaboration with [Opportunity Hack](https://www.ohack.org/), a local organization that pairs developers with non-profits who need custom software to accomplish their goals.
