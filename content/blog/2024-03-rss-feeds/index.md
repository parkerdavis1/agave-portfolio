I'm enjoying using an RSS feed reader lately and I think you ought to give it a try. macOS/iOS has a great free option [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) but there are [others](https://aboutfeeds.com)
## What is an RSS feed?

Check out [About Feeds](https://aboutfeeds.com/), it'll tell you what you need to know. 

## Any questions?

Check out this [todepond post](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/social-media/what-is-rss/matt-webb-answered/), it'll prompt some more (questions). 


## A short list of some favorite feeds:

[Bruiser](https://www.bruisermag.com/) - my friend Mark's online mag/(a)zine

[Waves and Gazes](https://wavesandgazes.live/) - my friend Chase's music writing newsletter

[Todepond dot com](https://www.todepond.com/) - my (parasocial) friend's online wikiblogarden

My site has a [feed](https://parkerdavis.dev/feed/feed.xml) of course. You don't need to know where the feed is though. Your feedreader will find the feed and read! 

## Advice

If you have a site, give it a feed!
