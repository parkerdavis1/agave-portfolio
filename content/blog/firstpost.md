## Beginnings
I decided a couple years ago I would teach myself to code. I have learned a ton and have made some [cool things](/#projects). Some people closest to me probably don't know that I am actively trying to transition into a career in software engineering. Or what I'm working on before I feel it is completely done. This is temp text!

## Jobs
I am about to start interviewing for many different jobs. One of the things I would like to do with this blog is share what I am learning on a more micro level. Tech interview questions like what is an HTML Doctype? My approach has been to learn as quickly as possible what I need to know in order to make something that works. If you asked me to explain what I am doing, I'd probably have a hard time and jumble up some of the jargon, since I rarely actually talk about this stuff. This blog is meant to change that. Share what I am learning, distill it into interesting chunks, solidify my own understanding, and give back to the developer community which is so open. This is a rough rough rough draft of a post.
