I tend to work in private. Only when I finish something do I start to consider telling other people about it. Some of my friends and family probably don't even know that I am actively seeking employment as a software engineer. This is a problem. This blog is an attempt to counter my private tendencies and take more of a ['Learn In Public'](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) approach.

## Audience

You may know that I have a [bird sound blog](https://birdsmakesound.com/) that explores the world of birds and sound. While it is written for a more general audience, this blog will be for other developers, or really, myself. The topics will be niche and developer-y. I hope it is of interest to anyone but a certain baseline of knowledge will be assumed. My goals are to sharpen my own understanding and be able to communicate what I learn effectively.

## Topics

### Trivia questions

As I mentioned, I'm looking for a job. I'm going to go through tech interviews to get a job. One component of tech interviews is answering trivia-style questions about the languages and technologies you use, such as "What is the purpose of the <!DOCTYPE html> tag in HTML?" â€“ that sounds like a pretty good post to me.

### Today I Learned (TIL)

No post is too short or topic too small. Learning is constant and I'd like to document some of the little "Ah-ha"s as I encounter them.  

### New technologies, new approaches

How could I use val.town to add a Like-counter to a static blog site? How does Hono compare to Express for building backend APIs? How do you create modals with the new native \<dialog\> element? Can I build a web audio player that pre-generates a spectrogram then uses canvas to scroll through it? As I find out, you better believe I'll post about it here.

### Project Updates

I always have several projects going at any given time with varying degrees of complexity and completeness. Expect occasional updates about any and all of them, old and new.
