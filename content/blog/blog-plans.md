## Hello!

Welcome to my personal/developer blog. You may know that I have a [bird sound blog](https://birdsmakesound.com/){title="Birds Make Sound"} that explores the world of birds, sound, and recording. While it is written for a more general audience, this blog will be for other developers, or really, myself. Of course I hope it is of interest to anyone but a baseline familiarity with coding will be assumed.

## Why?

One of the things I admire most about the online developer community is the commitment to sharing knowledge. I can't tell you how many times I've had a coding question, [ecosia'd](https://www.ecosia.org) it, and found someone's blog post answering my question. When I figure things out for myself I want to share my findings with others (and remind my future self).

Also, I tend to work in private. Some of my friends and family probably don't even know that I am actively seeking employment as a software engineer. This is a problem â€“ if people don't know I'm looking for work, they won't know to connect me with people who *have* work. This blog is an attempt to counter my private tendencies and take more of a ['Learn In Public'](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) approach.

Up until now I've been focused on walking the walk. Now, I'm also going to practice *talking the talk*.

## Topics

Some categories for upcoming posts:

### Today I Learned (TIL)

No post too short or topic too small. Learning is constant and I'd like to document some of the little *Ah-has* as I encounter them.

### Project Updates

I always have several projects going at any given time. Expect updates about any and all of them.

### "Trivia" questions

As I mentioned, I'm looking for a job. I'm going to have to go through tech interviews to get said job. One component of tech interviews is answering trivia-style questions about the languages and technologies you use, such as "What is the purpose of the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag in HTML?" This is well-trodden territory but that's not going to stop me from writing about it! *Plus, the answer is more interesting than you might think.*

### New technologies, new approaches

How could I use [val.town](https://www.val.town/) to add a Like counter to a static blog site? How does [Hono](https://hono.dev/) compare to [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for building backend APIs? How do you create modals with the new native [&lt;dialog&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) element? Can I build a web audio player that pre-generates a spectrogram then uses Canvas to scroll through it? What little treasures will I find as I delve deeper into auth, databases, CI/CD, devops. As I find out, you better believe I'll post about it here.

Check back soon, I'll be posting regularly. ðŸ‘‹
