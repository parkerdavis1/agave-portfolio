<p class="lede">I am a software engineer from Arizona. Iâ€™ve been building on the web since the early 2000s, from band websites to full-stack web applications. As a developer I love identifying and solving the many small puzzles to build towards big picture solutions, providing immediate and tangible value.</p>

Constant learning, consistent practice, and attention to detail have been the through line in my journey from professional musician to field biologist to software engineer. Mastering syntax and design patterns pulls from the same skills as learning to identify the sounds, field marks, and life histories of hundreds of species of birds. Building up UI components, functions, and database schemas into a seamlessly integrated and delightful user experience is not unlike building up and sequencing notes, timbres, and phrases into long-form musical compositions.
